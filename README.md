## Projects:
Currently, I've got two projects on my portfolio. While each one of them has a separate readme file, here is a short explanation of each one: 
1. [Tennis EDA Analysis](https://github.com/YoavWeller/Tennis_Analysis) - This project examines the crucial metrics around first serves, analyzing the differences between match winners and losers using an exploratory data analysis approach. I uncover patterns in serve percentages and effectiveness, providing insights into the pivotal role the first serve plays in determining match outcomes. This is the main project in my portfolio.
2. [Happiness and Corruption Dashboard](https://github.com/YoavWeller/Happiness_and_Corruption_Dashboard) - Since 2015 the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) has been publishing annually, ranking the happiness of countries all over the world. In this project, I created a dashboard depicting aggregated data from the 2015 to 2020 World Happiness Reports.
